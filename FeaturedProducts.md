    Double Espresso (Doppio)
    Rs.150

A double espresso (aka “Doppio”) is just that -- two espresso shots in one cup.

    Ristretto
    Rs.199

A ristretto is an espresso shot that is extracted with the same amount of coffee but half the amount of water. The end result is a more concentrated and darker espresso extraction.

    Cappuccino
    Rs.250

A cappuccino is similar to a latte. However the key difference between a latte and cappuccino is that a cappuccino has more foam and chocolate placed on top of the drink. Further a cappuccino is made in a cup rather than a tumbler glass.
