    Espresso (Short Black)

The espresso (aka “short black”) is the foundation and the most important part to every espresso based drink.

    Double Espresso (Doppio)

A double espresso (aka “Doppio”) is just that -- two espresso shots in one cup. 

    Short Macchiato

A short macchiato is similar to an espresso but with a dollop of steamed milk and foam to mellow the harsh taste of an espresso. You will find that baristas in different countries make short macchiatos differently.

    Long Macchiato

A long macchiato is the same as a short macchiato but with a double shot of espresso. The same rule of thirds applies in the traditionally made long macchiato.

    Ristretto

A ristretto is an espresso shot that is extracted with the same amount of coffee but half the amount of water. The end result is a more concentrated and darker espresso extraction.

    Long Black (Americano)
                            
A long black (aka “americano”) is hot water with an espresso shot extracted on top of the hot water.

    Cappuccino

A cappuccino is similar to a latte. However the key difference between a latte and cappuccino is that a cappuccino has more foam and chocolate placed on top of the drink. Further a cappuccino is made in a cup rather than a tumbler glass.
